Rain's falling down and just darkens the ground
A sound that I've heard before but I'm not sure
You keep me away from the place where you've been
But now I remember why you stay away from there

When you're falling to the ground
What do you see?
Your pride is going down with reality
You may try to stand up
But you'll realize your dreams are gone

The weight of my pride
Do I really need that?

The weight of my pride
Do I really need that?

You say we've talked before, I don't remember that
The weight of my pride has destroyed me again
But tell me how does it feel when you tell a lie
So tell me who's insane is it me or is it you?

When you're falling to the ground
What do you see?
Your pride is going down with reality
You may try to stand up
But you'll realize your dreams are gone

I know maybe I'm breaking down
But it's real man, this is another part of me
Forget that, everything you want me to say
Just leave me alone don't trust me for now

You say I'm crazy but you're already fucked up
Face up to yourself but you can't cuz you're a liar
Only thing you do is to run away from your truth
Big mouth, get your ass out of my town bitch

Rain's falling down and just darkens the ground
A sound that I've heard before but I'm not sure
You keep me away from the place where you've been
I tried to remember the place
Is that in my mind?

Is that in my mind?

When you're falling to the ground
What do you see?
Your pride is going down with reality
You may try to stand up
But you'll realize your dreams are gone

There is something that I miss in my life
There's nothing left to save that's inside of me
I might try to understand
Then I'll figure out my dreams are here
 
My dreams are here
My dreams are here
Yeah
