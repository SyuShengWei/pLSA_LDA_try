rain
Sometimes I wanna know why
One day I'm gonna realize

I think of you
In this freezing rain
It chills my heart
I've felt this lost before

I've tried my best
From the time we met
If I could start again
I'd make the same mistakes

When I close my eyes
I feel you close to me
If I could rewrite everything
Would it still end?

Sometimes I wanna know why
I let you slide away
One day I'm gonna realize
This time it's too late

The rain has stopped
But the streets are wet
The sky turns gray
It's the same everyday

Your philosophy
Is the opposite of me
But in the end
All I want is to understand

When I close my eyes
I feel you close to me
If I could rewrite everything
Would it still end?

Sometimes I wanna know why
I let you slide away
One day I'm gonna realize
This time it's too late

If I change my view
The way I look at you
If I could rewrite everything
How would it end?

Somewhere I know that there's sun
But our clouds, they block the way
I swear, I'm gonna find out
Before it's too late

I think of you
In this freezing rain
It chills my heart
I've felt this lost before

I've tried my best
From the time we met
If I could start again
I'd make the same mistakes

Your philosophy
Is the opposite of me
But in the end
All I want is to understand

When I close my eyes
I feel you close to me
If I could rewrite everything
Would it still end?

Sometimes I wanna know why
I let you slide away
One day I'm gonna realize
This time it's too late

If I change my view
The way I look at you
If I could rewrite everything
How would it end?

Somewhere I know that there's sun
But our clouds, they block the way
I swear, I'm gonna find out
Before it's too late

When I close my eyes
I feel you close to me
If I could rewrite everything
Would it still end?

Sometimes I wanna know why
I let you slide away
One day I'm gonna realize
This time it's too late
