I know It's been a while what happened to you?
In our memory we're still hanging out
strolling up and down 18th street
go to the liquor store to buy some beers
I don't remember, when was the last time
you said you couldn't live this life no more
at that moment I said life no it's not so bad
then you say yeah but sometimes I want to quit
people live their life
for what they believe
even if we have some reason to let it slide
sometimes life is not fair
I know that brings you down
why don't we live this life more simple just like you said
It's not the end
not even the beginning yeah

you keep it all inside bottled up
you never speak your mind open up
If you just let me in when you're falling apart
Just call me anytime I'll be there for you
I don't remember, when was the last time
you said you couldn't live this life no more
at that moment I said life no it's not so bad
then you say yeah but sometimes I want to quit
people live their life
for what they believe
even if we have some reason to let it slide
sometimes life is not fair
I know that brings you down
why don't we live this life more simple just like you said
It's not the end
not even the beginning
I wonder if I'll try to change to feel the world
Am I close to you?
close to you

I know It's been a while what happened to you?
In our memory we're still hanging out
strolling up and down 18th street
but now you're gone, I want you back

people live their life
for what they believe
even if we have some reason to let it slide
sometimes life is not fair
I know that brings you down
why don't we live this life more simple just like you said
It's not the end
not even the beginning
I wonder if I'll try to change to feel the world
Am I close to you?
close to you
close to you
